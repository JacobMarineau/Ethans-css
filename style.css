   CSS Tutorial for Ethan

/* Step 1: Style the Body */
/* The `body` tag controls the entire page's style. 
   - Add a background color.
   - Set a clean font-family (try 'Arial', 'Verdana', or 'sans-serif').
   - Add some padding so the content isn't too close to the edges.
   - Set a default text color.
*/

/* Step 2: Style the Header */
/* The `header` contains your name and contact info.
   - Center the text in the header.
   - Add a background color (try light gray or blue) to make it stand out.
   - Add some space (padding) inside the header.
   - Use a different font size for the h1 (your name) to make it stand out.
   - Try changing the color of the h1.
*/

/* Example: 
   Here's how you can style the header to get started.
*/
header {
    text-align: center; /* Centers the text */
    padding: 20px; /* Adds space around the content inside the header */
    background-color: #f4f4f4; /* Light gray background for the header */
  }
  
  /* Now, you can add styles to the h1 inside the header! */
  
  /* Step 3: Style the Header Info */
  /* You have your name, email, and phone number inside the header.
     - Add space between these items (hint: use margin).
     - Change the font size to make the contact info smaller than your name.
     - Try giving them a different color.
  */
  
  /* Step 4: Style the Container */
  /* The container holds everything (work experience, education).
     - Set a maximum width so the content doesnâ€™t get too wide on big screens.
     - Center the container on the page.
     - Add padding inside the container.
     - Add a background color (maybe white or light blue) and some shadow to make it pop.
     - Give the container rounded corners.
  */
  
  /* Example: Here's a guide for centering and limiting the width of the container */
  .container {
    max-width: 800px; /* Keeps the container from getting too wide */
    margin: 0 auto; /* Centers the container on the page */
  }
  
  /* Now try adding a background color, padding, and other styles! */
  
  /* Step 5: Style the Education and Work Experience Sections */
  /* The education and work experience sections are important.
     - Add some space between each job or school (hint: use margin or padding).
     - Give each section a light background to separate them.
     - You can add a border or a colored line on the left to make each section stand out.
     - Try adding a hover effect so the background changes when you move your mouse over the section.
  */
  
  /* Step 6: Style the Text */
  /* Text is one of the most important parts of a resume.
     - For the school or company names, make the text bold or use a larger font.
     - Add spacing between the paragraphs to make everything easy to read.
     - For completed tasks or important details, change the color of the text to something that stands out (maybe blue or green).
  */
  
  /* Step 7: Research Resources */
  /* To help you figure out what each CSS property does and how to use it, try looking up:
     - 'CSS font-family' to see how to change the font.
     - 'CSS padding vs margin' to learn about spacing inside and around elements.
     - 'CSS hover effect' to make things change when you hover over them.
     - 'CSS box-shadow' to make sections stand out with shadows.
  
     You can use websites like:
     - MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
     - W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
     - CSS-Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/)
  */
  
  /* Step 8: Mobile Friendly Design (Optional)
  /* If you want to make the page look good on phones, try using media queries.
     - Look up 'CSS media queries' and learn how to make the text and layout smaller when the screen gets too small.
     - You can start by setting a maximum width of 600px and reducing font sizes.
